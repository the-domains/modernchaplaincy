<p>Guiding Strala is a leader’s handbook exploring the principles and practice of embodying the concepts we desire to inspire others with. The concepts apply to how we are in our body and mind, how we move, how we practice consistently, and how we guide others to discover a sustainable and rewarding process of lasting change in them selves. This book is designed to accompany a Strala Training program you can find happening around the world with our faculty members, myself, my husband and epic natural mover, Mike Taylor, and our dear friend, support and shiatsu teacher and practitioner, Sam Berlind. My goal is to empower those who desire to lead others to an easful experience of life. Achieving more with less effort, conservation of energy, awareness of self and the world around us through the physical, mental, and emotional practice of Strala Yoga.</p><p>We are brining along a yoga that is relevant for our lives in this insanely fast paced day in age, where we have all the information at our fingertips, are constantly short on time, rushed, and frantic. Strala Yoga is the practice of slowing down, softening, and relearning how to move naturally with the goal of sensitizing to how we feel. The result is accomplishing more with less effort, sustainably. The effect is radiant health, happiness, and most exciting for the current times, dissolved stress.</p><p>Stress is our largest current crisis of the human race; the number one cause of obesity, a huge factor in our disconnection to our body, mind, and connection with nature. Our frazzled minds and disconnected bodies fixate on a quick fix, a fast meal, the fastest solution in a pill or a drink, and always at the cost of our wellbeing. Strala Yoga is focused on sensitizing to how you feel and guides others to experience the process, instead of focusing on perfecting a goal or in yoga’s case, the shape of an external pose. The result is realizing how we actually feel, and choosing to do something sustainable to remedy our situation. The practice helps us consider how we are, much more than what we are able to do, and expands our comfort zone toward progress from where we are, right now.</p><picture>

<p>Everyone is able to practice and the group experience is wonderfully diverse, celebrating individuality and collectiveness as we enjoy a lovely walk in the woods, appreciating the uniqueness of each tree, and the collectiveness of the forest. The practice of Strala, celebrates and reminds us that we are a part of nature, by guiding the actions of the process, letting us enjoy the effect, how we are able to interpret and understand individually.</p><p>The biggest wall we’ve hit with yoga in our current age is focusing on the external shape, body flexing, and goals and the work out of yoga poses. <b>All the ancient yoga texts remind us that yoga is an inside job,</b> the practice of experiencing our true nature, of wellbeing and oneness. However, many modern practices focus on stress collecting, body stiffening, extreme poses as goals, turning a practice capable of healing, into an activity that results in imbalance, causes of physical, mental and emotional injury, collects stress, and brings us further away from wellbeing.</p></div></section></div><section id="2" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="15"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="16"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="17"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="18"><span data-reactid="19"><!-- react-empty: 20 --><h2 data-reactid="21"><a data-reactid="22">ModernChaplaincy</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="23"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="24"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="25"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="26"></div></section></div></div>
